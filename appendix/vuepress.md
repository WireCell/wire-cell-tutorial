# Contribute to this tutorial

This tutorial is created using the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) static site generator. To contribute to the tutorial please let the site manager add you as a collaborator. Then, you can directly edit using the **"Edit this page"** link on each page. After the commit, the pages will be automatically re-built through [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.com/) (expecting a few minutes' delay).

Alternatively, you can write and build the tutorial on your own computer. You need to first install `node.js` and `npm` (e.g. [on ubuntu](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/)). I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for better version control.

## Install dependencies

```bash{2-4}
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash # or newer versions
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install node
npm install
```

## Start writing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-tutorial
cd wire-cell-tutorial
npm run dev
```

Now start editing the markdown files, and you should see changes at `http://localhost:8080/` . Once everything looks fine, you should commit the changes to GitHub and wait for Travis-CI to rebuild the site.

<!-- ::: tip
With permission you can build and deploy the pages yourself using the [deploy.sh](https://github.com/WireCell/wire-cell-tutorial/blob/master/deploy.sh) script.
